Scripts for the Overwatch Workshop custom games

*Currently ALL custom games in this repository here are work in progress and are still bug ridden / unbalanced*

#	Mystery Heroes x Gun Game
Classic Mystery Heroes game, but players switch to a random hero on every final blow in addition to the random switch on every death. Ult charge should be preserved when switching heroes.

Create a custom game with the preset for Mystery Heroes, then add the script to the workshop.

# QP Last Stand
Normal quick play rules apply. When a player dies, the player will enter a "Last Stand" mode. While in "Last Stand", ultimates and abilities are disabled, health is reduced to 50% and the player cannot be healed. "Last Stand" mode lasts for 5 seconds. If the player deals a final blow in this mode, all restrictions will be lifted and player continues to live. If player doesn't get a final blow, the player will be killed (and restrictions are lifted). If player is killed while "Last Stand", restrictions are lifted and respawn in spawn room as normal. "Last stand" can only be activated once after respawning.
Players in "Last Stand" state are indicted visually

Create a custom game with the preset for Quick Play, then add script to the workshop.
